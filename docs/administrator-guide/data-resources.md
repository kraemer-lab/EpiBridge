# Data Resources

Managing institutional data resources in EpiBridge.

EpiBridge registers existing institutional data resources; it does not provision,
synchronise, refresh, or manage the underlying data. The data itself lives
entirely outside the platform — the recommended deployment model is a read-only
volume mounted into the platform at a well-known location.

This separation is fundamental: the platform manages **metadata, access control,
and governance**, not the data itself.

## Adding a new data resource — four-step workflow

```
1. Provision your data     →  institution's infrastructure, outside EpiBridge
2. Mount at /read-only-data →  NFS, local disk, S3 FUSE — your choice
3. Register with EpiBridge  →  make new-data-resource + make register-resources
4. Publish terms           →  admin UI (dataset terms)
```

### Step 1 — Provision your data (outside EpiBridge)

Provision storage, place the data files, and configure access using your
institution's preferred approach. EpiBridge is not involved in this step.

### Step 2 — Mount at /read-only-data

Make the data accessible at a path that the platform can mount read-only.
The institution chooses the mechanism — NFS, local disk, cloud storage via
FUSE, or any other approach. See the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md)
and [Runtime Specification](../../vm/runtime.md) for details.

### Step 3 — Register with EpiBridge

Scaffold the resource skeleton, place data files, and register:

```bash
# Create the resource directory and template files
make new-data-resource ID=uk-biobank-serum NAME="UK Biobank Serum Biomarkers" PROVIDER=csv

# Place data files
cp /path/to/serum.csv resources/uk-biobank-serum/data/

# Add representative data for validation runs (optional)
cp /path/to/sample.csv resources/uk-biobank-serum/representative/

# Edit manifest.yaml, SCHEMA.md, DOCUMENTATION.md, and TERMS_OF_USE.md
# to match the dataset

# Register all resources with EpiBridge (create once, skip if exists)
make register-resources
```

To register a single resource after making changes:

```bash
make register-resource ID=uk-biobank-serum
```

The manifest is used to register the resource. After registration, operational
management occurs within EpiBridge through the admin API and UI.

### Step 4 — Publish terms

Through the admin UI, publish dataset terms of service for the resource.
This step is optional — resources without terms are immediately available
for use.

Once registered, the resource appears in the researcher catalogue and can be
attached to projects.

> **Developer cleanup:** `make dev-prune-resources` removes registered resources
> whose manifest directory no longer exists on disk. Resources still referenced
> by projects or bundles are preserved by database constraints. This is a
> developer utility only — it never runs automatically.

## What is a Data Resource?

A **Data Resource** represents an existing institutional data asset that has been
registered for analysis. The institution owns and manages the underlying data
files; EpiBridge provides a catalogue of available resources, access control,
and secure execution.

EpiBridge does **not** own, store, or manage scientific data. It never copies
data into its own storage. Instead, it describes where data lives, who may
access it, and how to mount it securely into analysis containers.

## Runtime Access Contract

When a Data Resource is allocated to a project and used in an analysis
execution, it is mounted inside the analysis container at a predictable
location:

```
/data/{alias}
```

The `alias` is defined in the manifest at resource creation time and is
**stable for the lifetime of the resource**. Changing the alias is a breaking
change — any analysis code that references the old path will fail.

Analysis code always uses this path regardless of:
- the provider type (CSV, DuckDB, Parquet, etc.);
- the deployment model (OrbStack, native Docker);
- whether the execution is validation (representative data) or governed
  (production data).

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("/data/demo-surveillance/demo.csv")
```

The alias and identifier often use the same value. This is the recommended
convention. They may differ when an institution has a specific reason to
separate the institutional label (`identifier`) from the runtime mount name
(`alias`).

## How data resources work

### Environment-agnostic model

From the platform's perspective, a Data Resource is:

- A **manifest** that describes the resource in YAML: its identifier, name,
  provider type, endpoint configuration, and status.
- A **registration** process that loads manifests into the database on startup.
- A **publication** mechanism that makes resources discoverable to researchers
  through the catalogue.
- An **allocation** model that authorises projects to use specific resources.

These concepts are independent of deployment technology.

#### Manifests

Data Resources are defined in YAML manifests. The manifest describes the
resource in deployment-agnostic terms:

```yaml
identifier: "uk-biobank-serum"
alias: "uk-biobank-serum"
name: "UK Biobank Serum Biomarker Data"
provider: "csv"
endpoint:
  path: "uk_biobank/serum.csv"
status: "active"
```

The `endpoint` describes *what* the resource is, not *where* it lives on disk.
How paths resolve to physical storage is the deployment's responsibility.

The manifest directory (`RESOURCE_MANIFEST_DIR`) is scanned on startup and
during explicit registration commands. Registration is idempotent — new
manifests create new records; previously registered manifests are skipped
without overwriting the database.

The manifest is used to register the resource. After registration, operational
management occurs within EpiBridge through the admin API and UI.

Each manifest may also include:
- **Documentation** — schemas, READMEs, and usage guidance for researchers
- **Representative datasets** — structurally identical subsets for operational
  validation (see [Validation in the Researcher
  Guide](../user-guides/researcher.md#validation))

#### Registration

Registration happens automatically at startup and can be triggered explicitly:

```
Startup (automatic)          Explicit (via CLI)
       │                            │
       ▼                            ▼
   Load all manifests         make register-resources
       │                            │
       ▼                            ▼
   Validate each manifest           │
       │                            │
       ▼                            ▼
   For each entry:
     ├── Not in DB → create
     └── Already in DB → skip (never overwrite)
```

Resources that were previously registered are preserved exactly as-is.
Registration never overwrites runtime state.

#### Publication

Once registered, resources appear in the researcher-facing catalogue.
Researchers can browse available resources, view schemas and documentation,
and discover which resources are relevant to their work.

Resources may optionally have **Dataset Terms of Service** published against
them. When dataset terms are published, researchers must accept them before
attaching the resource to a project or submitting a bundle that references it.

#### Project allocation

Resources are attached to projects through **ProjectResourceAllocation**
records. Each allocation captures:
- Who authorised it
- When it was created
- Which project and resource it connects

An allocation is active until explicitly revoked. Revocation records who and
when, for audit purposes.

Allocation is an institutional provisioning decision — it says "this project
is authorised to use this resource." It does not move or copy data.

### Environment-aware model

In an institutional deployment, the above concepts map to physical
infrastructure.

#### Recommended: host-managed storage

The recommended deployment pattern keeps authoritative datasets **outside** the
EpiBridge execution environment. Institutional storage is managed directly by
the institution and mounted read-only into the platform.

```
Host filesystem
  └── /data/institutional/uk-biobank/serum.csv  (managed by IT)
        │
        ▼ (bind mount, read-only)
  Platform VM / container
  └── /read-only-data/uk-biobank/serum.csv
        │
        ▼ (provider resolution during execution)
  Analysis container
  └── /data/uk-biobank/serum.csv  (read-only)
```

**Why this is recommended:**

1. **Data never enters the platform's storage.** The platform does not copy,
   ingest, or transform the data. It only mounts the authorised subset into
   analysis containers.
2. **The VM is disposable.** If the VM is lost (crash, rebuild, migration), the
   data survives in its original location. Recovery requires only updating the
   mount path.
3. **Backup is the institution's responsibility.** Institutional backup policies
   apply directly to the authoritative storage. EpiBridge never needs to
   restore data — only its own metadata (which is backed up separately).
4. **Access control is layered.** The host filesystem permissions protect data
   at rest. EpiBridge adds project-scoped authorisation at runtime. Both must
   be satisfied.

#### Read-only mounts

Data resources are mounted **read-only** inside analysis containers. The
analysis code can read data but cannot modify it. This is enforced at the
container level by Docker bind mount permissions and at the executor level by
the platform.

#### VM disposability

Because authoritative data lives outside the EpiBridge VM, the VM is fully
disposable. You can:

- Destroy and recreate the VM without data loss.
- Migrate to a new VM by updating mount paths.
- Run multiple VM instances (staging, production) from the same data store.

The only state the VM owns is:
- PostgreSQL database (users, projects, bundles, audit events)
- Redis data (work queue — ephemeral)
- Uploaded bundle archives (can be re-uploaded)
- Release packages (archived outputs — should be backed up)

#### Backup implications

Because data lives outside EpiBridge:

- **Institutional data** is backed up by the institution's existing storage
  infrastructure. EpiBridge has no role in this.
- **Platform database** (users, projects, bundles, audit events) must be backed
  up via `backup.sh`. This is the only EpiBridge-owned state that cannot be
  recreated.
- **Release packages** (delivered outputs) should be archived to long-term
  storage outside the platform for compliance reasons.
- **Configuration** (`.env`) must be backed up separately as it contains
  secrets.

## Provider types

EpiBridge supports multiple data backends through a **Provider** abstraction.
Each provider knows how to make a specific type of data available inside an
analysis container:

| Provider | Data type | Use case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| CSV | Single CSV file | Simple tabular data |
| DuckDB | DuckDB database file | Analytical queries |
| PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL database | Managed relational data |
| Excel | Excel workbook | Spreadsheet data |
| Parquet | Directory of Parquet files | Columnar storage |

The provider describes *what* to expose (source path, type) and *how* to expose
it (mount points, environment variables). An Executor (Docker, Kubernetes,
etc.) translates these into the corresponding infrastructure.

For the stable runtime path where resources appear inside analysis containers,
see [Runtime Access Contract](#runtime-access-contract).

## Manifest reference

### Required fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `identifier` | string | Stable institutional ID. Must match the parent directory name. |
| `name` | string | Human-readable display name shown in the catalogue. |
| `alias` | string | Filesystem-safe mount name. Must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`. Becomes `/data/{alias}` in execution containers. |
| `provider` | string | One of: `csv`, `duckdb`, `postgres`, `excel`, `parquet`. |
| `endpoint` | object | Provider-specific configuration. See endpoint shapes below. |

### Optional fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | string | `""` | Free-text description for the researcher catalogue. |
| `version` | string | `"1.0.0"` | Resource version identifier. |
| `status` | string | `"active"` | Platform-managed resource availability. Administrators do not normally set this field — resources are registered as `active` by default. |

### Endpoint shapes by provider

| Provider | Endpoint shape |
|----------|----------------|
| CSV | `{"path": "<relative-path>"}` |
| DuckDB | `{"path": "<relative-path>"}` |
| Excel | `{"path": "<relative-path>"}` |
| Parquet | `{"path": "<relative-path>"}` |
| PostgreSQL | `{"host": "...", "database": "...", "schema": "..."}` |

The `path` is relative to `/read-only-data`. The platform resolves it at
execution time.
