# multipass.sh — Multipass VM helper for EpiBridge
#
# Provides VM lifecycle operations through the same interface as
# orbstack.sh, enabling the platform.sh abstraction layer to manage
# a Multipass-backed execution environment.

# VM resource defaults — overridable via environment variables.
# The platform runs Docker Engine, PostgreSQL, Redis, backend,
# frontend, worker, Caddy, BuildKit, and optionally Ollama
# simultaneously.  These defaults provide comfortable headroom
# for the full stack plus Docker image builds.
# 60G disk accommodates the Docker image cache plus the Ollama
# model (~4GB) with room to spare.
