# setup-certs.sh — generate TLS certificates for local HTTPS
#
# If mkcert is available, generates a locally-trusted certificate.
# Otherwise, falls back to a self-signed certificate with a clear
# message explaining how to enable trusted local HTTPS later.
#
# Idempotent: if a certificate already exists and mkcert is not
# available (so no upgrade is possible), exits without regenerating.
# If mkcert becomes available later, re-running upgrades to trusted.
#
# Reads PUBLIC_URL from .env (defaults to https://localhost).
#
# Output: certs/<hostname>.pem, certs/<hostname>-key.pem
